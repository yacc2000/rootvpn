Android application, widget, and service which can start a user-configured PPTP VPN connection (using root).

Leverages Android's command line mtpd and route commands to start and stop VPN connection.

Includes Intents which can be called and listened for - from other Android applications, which in turn are able to start and stop the VPN connection programatically.

Can be used on its own, or in conjunction with homewatcher:
